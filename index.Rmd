## Bucharest

- really old district boundaries
- not enough district boundaries
- communication between sectors is bad --> lit/examples

- Bucharest is a city in transition from its communist past to a market economy
- Problems: 
Lack of effective and strictly enforced regulation and public sector indecision
Problems inherited from the Ceausescu regime, generate many examples of poor urban planning and management

E.g. Văcăreşti “Lake

## our aim of the project
- Change the boundaries
- expand urban boundaries to enhance urban functioning, quality of life, efficiency
- what will this contribute: new approach to improve urban planning, 
- assumption the existing urban planning is changing the boundaries ---> this is new and 
- provide the current policies in Bucharest(that focus on quality of life through urban planning) and say we want to have a novel approach 
- healthy cities SDGs

##Aim of the project2
- quality of life
- examples of how poorly planned cities affect quality of life
- examples of how good cities planning affect quality of life
- Remote sensing is not often used for uQOL
- importance: why quality of life is important, and why district boundaries affect uQOL?
- picture of the uQOL indicator

.panel[ .panel-name[**Further Steps**]

- Quarterly surveys for 3 years to understand:

  - How local population react to the new boundaries/districts

  - If implementation of policies and communication between district has become better

- If the project is not completed within 4 months the timeline can be extended to accommodate this 

- If implementation successful, we can use framework for use in other cities

  - provides reproducible modelling and output which, when adapted, can benefit other cities

- Open source data 
- Return on investment - one time cost of data analysis
- Using [Worldview](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-h7qawudun3pcw?sr=0-70&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa#offers) for Bucharest Demographic

# Limitation, Risks and Migitations

.space[.panelset[
.panel[ .panel-name[.center[Modelling Limitations]]

.bigger[**Issue**]
- Modelling might fail
- Machine learning might not be useful 

.bigger[**Proposed Fix**]
- Taking a more manual angle by overlaying land usage with night time imagery
- Using population density to validate boundaries 
]
.panel[ .panel-name[Physical Limitations]
.bigger[**Issue**]
- New boundaries produced by the model may not be convenient
- Might cross private property, protected spaces which make implementation more difficult

.bigger[**Proposed Fix**]
- Expert Opinion from Anthropological Consultant to account for feasibility of such implementation and in accordance with the preferences of local populations
- Flexibility on the boundary definition
]
.panel[ .panel-name[Immediate Project Potential Limitations]
.bigger[**Issue**]
- Differences in opinion of stakeholders and population
- Less clear return on investment/more time needed
- Difficulty combining data sources to define boundaries  

.bigger[**Proposed Fix**]
- Project costs are fairly low
- Remaining budget for extending the plan if needed and taking time to create new models
- Discuss outputs with stakeholders

# Future work and contributions

.space[

- After trial period (1 year) restults are estimated to start appearing
  - If successful **can be applied to other cities !**

- Incorporated into SDG's healthy cities and healthy lives framework

- **Further analysis possible:**

  - time series could be incorporated to allow for prediction of urban growth
  - record where boundaries might need to be in the future
  - using framework in other countries/cities with **similar characteristics**
  
- Anticipate urban growth and change
