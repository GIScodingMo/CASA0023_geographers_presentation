# Background of Bucharest

- really old district boundaries
- not enough district boundaries
- communication between sectors is bad --> lit/examples

- Bucharest is a city in transition from its communist past to a market economy
- Problems: 
Lack of effective and strictly enforced regulation and public sector indecision
Problems inherited from the Ceausescu regime, generate many examples of poor urban planning and management

  - If implementation of policies and communication between district has become better

- If the project is not completed within 4 months the timeline can be extended to accommodate this 

- If implementation successful, we can use framework for use in other cities

# Future work, contributions and effects

.space[

- After trial period (1 year) restults are estimated to start appearing
  - If successful **can be applied to other cities !**

- Incorporated into SDG's healthy cities and healthy lives framework

- **Further analysis possible:**

  - time series could be incorporated to allow for prediction of urban growth
  - record where boundaries might need to be in the future
  - using framework in other countries/cities with **similar characteristics**
  
- Anticipate urban growth and change
